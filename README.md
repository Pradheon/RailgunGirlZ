# RailgunGirlZ

## Description
RailgunGirlZ is a a 2D Action RPG game made in Python using Pygame and Pygwidget packages.
This is a game taking elements from my other game "Neko Quest", miHoYo's Gun GirlZ, and the Railgun series and combining it all into one game.
Play as Mikoto Misaka as you fight your way through Academy City's toughest foes to save the city, once again, from the enemies that aim to destory Academy City.
Inspired by Gun GirlZ. Based on "A Certian Scientific Railgun" series by Kazuma Kamachi and Motoi Fuyukawa.
